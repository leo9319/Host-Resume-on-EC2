            Cody was seen roaming a busy city street, his coat tangled and his eyes reflecting a sense of loss. He was brought to a shelter by a concerned neighbor. Despite the chaos of his past, Cody's exuberant personality couldn't be dampened. He was always eager for a walk or a friendly pat. His chance for happiness arrived when a family with two playful children chose him. Cody's new life is filled with joyful runs in the park, endless games of fetch, and cozy nights surrounded by a family who adores him, his tail always wagging with gratitude.

            Thumper was discovered in an abandoned garden, his fur unkempt and his demeanor timid. Taken in by Harmony Haven, he was gently cared for, his health and spirits slowly reviving. Despite his initial wariness, Thumper's affectionate nature gradually emerged. He had a particular fondness for soft blankets and quiet afternoons in the sun. His patience paid off when he was adopted by an elderly couple, seeking a serene companion for their tranquil home. Thumper now spends his days lounging in sunlit spots and being doted on, a beloved member of his new family.

            Luna was found hiding under a porch, her sleek black fur dull and her trust in people worn thin. A concerned neighbor brought her to us, where she was given a safe haven. Luna was initially distant, but her curiosity and playfulness slowly surfaced. She especially enjoyed chasing laser pointers and napping in cozy corners. Her turning point came when she was adopted by a young couple looking for a new addition to their family. Luna now lives a life full of affection, her evenings spent watching the sunset from a warm windowsill.
